- Hello people, I’m halcyon-jyz, but you can just call me hal.
- I’m interested in sleeping and eating (also STEM and modeling).
- I’m currently learning Blender.
- I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment!
- Pronouns: she/they.
- Fun fact: my MBTI is ISTJ-T, which sometimes switches to ISTP-A.
